# [@voicybot](https://t.me/voicybot) main repository

This repository contains the code for one of the most popular bots I've ever built for Telegram — [@voicybot](https://t.me/voicybot). Please, feel free to fork, add features and create pull requests so that everybody (over 600 000 chats) can experience the features you've built.

You can also help by translating the bot to other languages or fixing some texts in existing languages by modifying the `locales` folder.
